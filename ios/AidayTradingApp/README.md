# AidayTrading iOS Client

This SwiftUI application provides the secure mobile entry point for the AidayTrading platform. It focuses on authentication, approval workflows, and role-aware navigation while enforcing strong client-side security controls.

## Features

- Signup and login flows with password strength validation (minimum 8 characters, upper/lowercase, and numeric characters).
- Account approval status detection with a dedicated pending screen after registration.
- JWT and refresh-token management stored securely in the system Keychain.
- Automatic session bootstrap with refresh token handling and biometric re-authentication.
- Role-based UI that surfaces Admin tooling only for approved administrators.
- Sensitive screen protections including Face ID / Touch ID gating, idle-timeout logout, and screen capture monitoring.
- Guided password reset experience wired to `/auth/forgot-password` and delivered via secure email.
- Unit and integration tests covering authentication, token handling, role detection, and approval workflow.
- Viewer dashboards with an equity curve chart, calendar heatmap computed in Central Time, and a paginated trade ledger.
- Live WebSocket streaming keeps status, equity, and trades current without 10-minute polling delays while retaining disk-cache fallbacks for offline resilience.
- Push notifications delivered via Firebase Cloud Messaging with in-app banners, deep linking into the correct tab, and background delivery when the app is terminated.
- A first-class Notifications tab aggregates push payloads and realtime system events with filtering, swipe-to-delete, and JSON inspection.
- Local notification fallback warns the operator if the realtime feed stalls or reconnect attempts exceed the backoff window.

## Viewer dashboards

- **Dashboard tab** â€“ Presents the latest system status, balance, P/L metrics, and equity curve using the finance-grade theme in `AidaytradingApp/Foundation/DesignSystem`. Data loads instantly from disk cache and streams live via `TradingWebSocketClient` so charts animate as soon as backend telemetry arrives.
- **Calendar tab** â€“ Uses `CalendarViewModel` and `CalendarPnLComputer` to group closed trades into Central Time day buckets. Tapping a day reveals trade-level details.
- **Trades tab** â€“ Driven by `TradesViewModel` with client-side filters (symbol, outcome, date range) and infinite scroll pagination backed by `TradesRepositoryImpl`.
- Snapshot test fixtures in `Tests/AidayTradingAppTests/UI/Snapshot` render light-weight previews for the Dashboard and Calendar tabs.

## Calendar PnL computation

- `Domain/Repositories/CalendarPnLComputer.swift` aggregates closed trades by Central Time midnight using timezone-safe helpers.
- Open trades (`closed_at == nil`) are ignored until they settle.
- Unit tests in `CalendarPnLComputerTests` cover timezone boundaries and edge cases.

## Trades filters & pagination

- `TradesListView` hosts `FiltersView`, allowing symbol selection, win/loss toggles, and optional date range filtering.
- `TradesViewModel` keeps an in-memory trade cache, applies filters client-side, and requests the next page when the user nears the end of the list.

## Realtime streaming & notification center

- `TradingWebSocketClient` maintains a TLS-secured connection to `AppConfig.webSocketURL`, authenticating with the user's JWT and emitting strongly typed Combine publishers for equity, trades, and status.
- Exponential backoff (1s â†’ 60s) drives reconnection attempts; the client deduplicates equity snapshots, trade IDs, and bot status timestamps to prevent jitter.
- `HomeViewModel` and `TradesViewModel` subscribe to the publishers so UI state updates within ~100ms of a server event, animating the equity curve and appending trades in place.
- `NotificationManager` bridges APNs/FCM push tokens to the backend, stores payloads in a Core Data SQLite store, and binds to realtime publishers to mirror important events as in-app alerts.
- The Notifications tab displays historical alerts with Central Time annotations, emoji status icons (ðŸš€, âœ‹, ðŸ“Š), and a JSON detail view, giving operators a compliant audit trail without relying on Telegram.


## Admin controls

- **Admin tab** â€“ Available only to administrator accounts. Surfaces bot controls, risk guardrails, user management, and an audit feed of the last ten configuration changes.
- **Bot control** â€“ Start/stop the trading loop, toggle between paper and live with destructive confirmation, and view the latest execution timestamp. Every action persists locally and mirrors into the Notifications tab.
- **Risk guardrails** â€“ Fintech-grade cards expose sliders and steppers for max drawdown, daily loss, per-trade risk, ATR multipliers, and open-position limits. Inputs clamp to backend-approved ranges before PATCHing `/admin/risk`.
- **User management** â€“ Approve pending signups, disable compromised accounts, adjust roles, and trigger Brevo password resets. Swipe actions mirror App Store moderation flows, while tapping a row opens a detailed control sheet.
- **Operational audit** â€“ Changes are stored through `AdminChangeLogRepository`, rendering the most recent ten actions inline and mirroring them to the Alerts tab for lightweight compliance.

The admin workflow uses `AdminRepositoryImpl` for privileged API mutations and streams successes through `AdminViewModel` to both the change log store and `NotificationManager` banners.

## Accessibility & localization

- All metrics and heatmap cells expose VoiceOver labels describing amounts and sentiment.
- Dynamic Type and right-to-left layout are supported across the dashboard module.
- Currency formatting respects the user's locale while forcing USD as the currency code, and percent formatting includes explicit sign handling for clarity.

## Getting started

1. Install [XcodeGen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen) if you prefer generating the Xcode project from configuration:

   ```bash
   brew install xcodegen
   ```

2. Generate the Xcode project:

   ```bash
   cd ios/AidayTradingApp
   xcodegen generate
   ```

3. Open the project in Xcode and configure your signing team if required:

   ```bash
   open AidayTradingApp.xcodeproj
   ```

4. Create a `.xcconfig` or use Xcode build settings to inject the backend base URL if it differs from the default (`https://api.aidaytrading.com`).

## Backend integration

The app expects the backend (Prompt A) to expose HTTPS endpoints:

- `POST /auth/signup` â†’ `{ "user": { ... } }`
- `POST /auth/login`  â†’ `{ "tokens": { ... }, "user": { ... } }`
- `POST /auth/refresh`
- `GET /users/me`
- `GET /ws` (authenticated WebSocket that multiplexes JSON envelopes such as `{ "type": "equity_update", "ts": 1695866400000, "equity": 12432.55 }`, `{ "type": "trade_executed", ... }`, and `{ "type": "bot_status", ... }`)
- `POST /api/v1/notifications/devices` expecting `{ "token": string, "platform": "ios", "timezone": string }`
- `GET /api/v1/notifications/preferences`
- `PUT /api/v1/notifications/preferences` with `{ "botEventsEnabled": bool, "reportsEnabled": bool }`
- `DELETE /api/v1/notifications/devices` with `{ "token": string }` to unregister stale tokens when an admin toggles delivery off.
- Remote notification payloads should include a `target` field (`home`, `trades`, `calendar`, `notifications`, or `admin`) so the app can deep link when the user taps alerts. Schedule balance/PnL recaps at 8am, 2pm, 8pm, and 2am Central Time (US Central) and send bot state changes via FCM topics or user-specific tokens. Payloads must omit secrets and include a unique `notification_id` for deduplication.

Responses should encode dates using ISO-8601 to match the bundled `JSONDecoder` configuration.

## Security considerations

- Tokens are persisted using the Keychain with the `kSecAttrAccessibleAfterFirstUnlockThisDeviceOnly` protection class.
- Face ID / Touch ID is required immediately after login or when restoring an existing session.
- An idle timer signs users out after 15 minutes of inactivity.
- Sensitive screens are blurred if a screen capture is detected, discouraging screenshots.
- The `APIClient` refuses to execute non-HTTPS requests.

## Testing & CI hooks

From the repository root you can execute unit tests via `xcodebuild` once the project is generated:

```bash
cd ios/AidayTradingApp
xcodegen generate
xcodebuild \
  -scheme AidayTradingApp \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15' \
  test
```

To validate push payload rendering in the simulator, craft an `.apns` file and execute `xcrun simctl push booted com.aidaytrading.app payload.apns` after launching the app.

Static analysis can be plugged in using SwiftLint by adding a `.swiftlint.yml` configuration at the project root. Ensure your CI environment runs:

```bash
swiftlint
xcodebuild test
```

Automated tests use a mocked WebSocket server to validate reconnect logic, push-token registration, and notification routing behaviour. You can execute the tests via:

```bash
cd ios/AidayTradingApp
xcodegen generate
xcodebuild \
  -scheme AidayTradingApp \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15' \
  test
```

New admin test suites cover view-model clamping (`AdminViewModelsTests`), change-log pipelines (`AdminIntegrationTests`), and SwiftUI rendering (`AdminViewSnapshotTests`). Run the full suite with `xcodebuild test` to verify privileged workflows before shipping.

Realtime streaming and push notification logic are exercised via Combine-driven tests in `NotificationManagerTests` and `TradesViewModelRealtimeTests`, which rely on mocked WebSocket publishers and an in-memory Core Data store.

## Environment configuration

- Configure environment variables for any secrets (e.g., Brevo API key) at the backend level. The iOS client never stores or hardcodes sensitive values.
- Update `APIEnvironment.baseURL` to point to your deployment if it changes.
- Add your Firebase `GoogleService-Info.plist` under `Sources/AidayTradingApp/Application/` before building. The app registers for push notifications via Firebase Messaging and expects APNs credentials configured in the Firebase console.
- Enable the `Push Notifications` capability in your Apple Developer account and ensure the `remote-notification` background mode entitlement is granted.

## Next steps

- Expand admin tooling with approval actions (approve/reject users, manage risk limits).
- Add push notification support for approval status changes.
- Expose per-strategy realtime feeds and fine-grained notification routing once additional bot telemetry is available.
